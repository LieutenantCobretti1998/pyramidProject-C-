**Pyramid Pattern Printer**

**Description:**
This C++ program takes a string input from the user and prints a pyramid pattern using characters from the input string. Each row of the pyramid consists of characters from the input string, forming an expanding pyramid shape.

**How to Use:**
1. Run the program.
2. Enter a string when prompted.
3. The program will generate and print a pyramid pattern using the characters from the input string.

**Features:**
- Generates a pyramid pattern using the characters from the input string.
- Handles strings of any length.
- Allows for input of multi-word strings.

**Components:**
- `printPyramidPattern(const string& input)`: This function takes a string input and prints the corresponding pyramid pattern.
- `main()`: The main function prompts the user for input, reads the input string, and calls `printPyramidPattern` to print the pyramid pattern.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- Understanding of nested loops for pattern generation.
- Usage of string manipulation functions like `length()` and `getline()`.
- Utilization of string concatenation and manipulation to create the desired pattern.
- Mastery of basic C++ syntax and control flow structures.

**Additional Notes:**
- The program uses the `string` class from the C++ Standard Library to handle user input and manipulate strings.
- The `printPyramidPattern` function utilizes nested loops to generate the pyramid pattern efficiently.
- This project enhances understanding of string handling, looping, and output formatting in C++.
